# Contributing to FramePack Studio

First off, thank you for considering contributing to FramePack Studio! We love your help in building this project. Every contribution is greatly appreciated.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to FramePack Studio to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process for everyone involved.

## How to Contribute

We welcome many forms of contributions, including but not limited to:

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue in our issue tracker.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement? Feel free to open an issue to discuss it.
*   **Writing Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation is crucial. We appreciate any help in improving our docs.
*   **Submitting Pull Requests:** If you want to contribute code, please follow the guidelines in this document.

## Coding Style

To maintain a consistent codebase, we use `ruff` for linting and formatting. All contributions must adhere to the default `ruff` style.

## PR Guidlines
- Keep Pull Requests Focused: Each Pull Request should address a single issue or add one specific feature. Please do not mix bug fixes, new features, and code refactoring in the same PR.
- Target the develop Branch: All Pull Requests must be opened against the develop branch. PRs opened against the main branch will be closed.
- Discuss Big Changes First: If you plan to work on a large feature or a significant refactor, please announce it first in the #contributors channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/MtuM7gFJ3V). This helps us coordinate efforts and prevent duplicate work.
